        <h1>Personas and Storyboard for Campus Vending Machine</h1>

        <h2>Public Interface: Campus Vending Machine</h2>

        <div>
            
            <div>
                Vending machines provide quick and easy access to a variety of snacks and drinks; a vending machine 
                interface makes the process of buying a snack quicker and more convenient by offering variable payment 
                options and eliminating interaction between the customer and salespeople.
            </div>

            <h3>Key Components</h3>

        <h2>Process</h2>

        <div>

            <div>
                I observed several users of an on campus vending machine, once in the day and once later at night (around 11 PM).
            </div>

            <div>
                <h3>Key Observations</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>All users used the card reader for payment (credit/debit cards or student ID cards). </li>
                    <li>
                        All users swiped their card through the card reader multiple times, either flipping the card around or 
                        changing the direction in which they swiped.
                    </li>
                    <li>All users checked the screen after swiping their cards to see if it had worked.</li>
                    <li>
                        Most users looked back and forth between the display window and keypad multiple times before inputting 
                        their selection.
                    </li>
                    <li>Most users inputted their selections slowly and carefully.</li>
                    <li>
                        More users approached the vending machine at night than in the day. A few swiped once, didn't make 
                        a selection, and went away.
                    </li>
                    <li>Most users purchased one item.</li>
                    <li>
                        One user purchased multiple items (during the day), repeating the swipe-select-collect process multiple 
                        times - this user apologized repeatedly to the person next to them for the time it took.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div>
                I also interviewed three users for deeper insights.

                <h3>Interview Summary</h3>
    
                <h4>Questions</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>What motivates you to use a campus vending machine?</li>
                    <li>Is there a typical pattern to the times that you use vending machines?</li>
                    <li>Which method of payment do you like best?</li>
                    <li>Have you experienced any challenges in the process of using campus vending machines?</li>
                    <li>What would be your ideal way of conducting a full transaction at a vending machine?</li>
                </ol>
    
                <h4>Answers</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        There were two major motivations: first, to stock up on stacks after running out, and if the user has a lot
                        of points to spend on their student card; second, as a last resort when a user needs
                        a hit of sugar and nothing else is open or nearby.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Users tend to use vending machines more often at night, during weekdays, and during colder months
                        of the year.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Users prefer card payments since they do not typically carry cash or coins - either the student card if 
                        they have points on it, or credit/debit cards.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        It's difficult to tell which way to swipe your card and whether it has worked; you cannot buy lots of 
                        things with one swipe and must do multiple transactions; using a credit card loads a default $4 into the
                        machine even if you only want one item; there's no indication of how much time you have to make your
                        selections before the machine shuts down your transaction; and the collection door is low and annoying
                        to use.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Two distinct ideas were brought up: first, to swipe a card at the machine and have it just take the 
                        cost of the desired item, so there is no waste of money; second, to enter a total amount of money, add 
                        items until meeting that total, and be able to buy them all at once instead of one at a time, saving
                        time.
                    </li>
                </ol>
