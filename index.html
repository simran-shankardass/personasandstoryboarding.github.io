                    Vending machines provide quick and easy access to a variety of snacks and drinks; a vending machine 
                    interface makes the process of buying a snack quicker and more convenient by eliminating interaction 
                    between the customer and salespeople. Users can view which items are in stock,
                    choose from multiple payment options, input the code of the desired item, and collect it from the slot it
                    falls into.

                <h4>Key Components</h4>
    
                <ul>
                    <li>Display window: enables users to view items in stock, prices, and item codes. Users can also watch their item fall and notice if it gets stuck.</li>
                    <li>Keypad with buttons: enables users to input the code of the item they want.</li>
                    <li>Bill slot: users can insert bills for payment.</li>
                    <li>Coin slot: users can insert coins for payment.</li>
                    <li>Change collection slot: change is left here for users to retrieve it.</li>
                    <li>Card reader: users can swipe a debit, credit, or student card here for payment.</li>
                    <li>LCD panel: displays messages throughout the process to keep users informed.</li>
                    <li>Button to cancel transaction: enables user to stop the transaction before receiving an item and initiates the refund.</li>
                    <li>Door flap: users can push this in to access the area where the item falls.</li>
                    <li>Graphics and text: these give the user instructions on how to use the machine.</li>
                </ul>

            </div>

                <p>
                    I observed several users of an on campus vending machine, during the day and later at night, to find general patterns of behaviour,
                    outliers, and pain points. I made the following key observations:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>All users used the card reader for payment (credit/debit cards or student ID cards).</li>
                    <li>All users swiped their card through the card reader multiple times, either flipping the card around or 
                        changing the direction in which they swiped.</li>
                    <li>All users checked the screen after swiping their cards to see if it had worked.</li>
                    <li>Most users inputted their selections slowly and carefully.</li>
                    <li>More users approached the vending machine at night than in the day.</li>
                    <li>Most users purchased one item. One user purchased multiple items, repeating the swipe-select-collect process multiple 
                        times - they apologized repeatedly to the person next to them for the time it took.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>I also interviewed three users for deeper insights.</p>

                <h4>Interview Summary</h4>
                <h5>Questions</h5>
                <ol>
                    <li>What motivates you to use a campus vending machine?</li>
                    <li>Is there a typical pattern to the times that you use vending machines?</li>
                    <li>Which method of payment do you like best?</li>
                    <li>Have you experienced any challenges in the process of using campus vending machines?</li>
                    <li>What would be your ideal way of conducting a full transaction at a vending machine?</li>
                </ol>
                <h5>Answers</h5>
                <ol>
                    <li>There were two major motivations: first, to stock up on stacks after running out, and if the user has a lot
                        of points to spend on their student card; second, as a last resort when a user needs
                        a hit of sugar and nothing else is open or nearby.</li>
                    <li>Users tend to use vending machines more often at night, during weekdays, and during colder months
                        of the year.</li>
                    <li>Users prefer card payments since they do not typically carry cash or coins - either the student card if 
                        they have points on it, or credit/debit cards.</li>
                    <li>It's difficult to tell which way to swipe your card and whether it has worked; you cannot buy lots of 
                        things with one swipe and must do multiple transactions; using a credit card loads a default $4 into the
                        machine even if you only want one item; there's no indication of how much time you have to make your
                        selections before the machine shuts down your transaction; and the collection door is low and annoying
                        to use.</li>
                    <li>Two distinct ideas were brought up: first, to swipe a card at the machine and have it just take the 
                        cost of the desired item, so there is no waste of money; second, to enter a total amount of money, add 
                        items until meeting that total, and be able to buy them all at once instead of one at a time, saving
                        time.</li>
                </ol>

                            Betty is a college student who has run out of snacks and wants to stock up on more, using up the points left on her student card so she doesn’t have to spend her own money.
                            For Betty, it isn't immediately clear which way to swipe her card; she has to repeat the entire process for each item she wants to buy; and the collection slot is low, which is annoying because she has to bend down so many times to collect her items.
                            Betty represents users who want to buy a lot of items from a nearby vending machine instead of going further to a store, but don’t like that it takes so much time.

                            Liam is a student who stays up late studying and needs a sugar hit; since stores are closed, he reluctantly uses a vending machine despite the higher prices.
                            For Liam, it isn't immediately clear which way to swipe his card to make it work; the machine takes a default $4 from his card, even though he only wants one thing worth $1.75; and no two items he wants add up to $4, so he ends up wasting some money.
                            Liam represents users who use vending machines when there is no other option, and value being able to buy just what they need and move on.
