                    Vending machines provide quick and easy access to a variety of snacks and drinks; a vending machine 
                    interface makes the process of buying a snack quicker and more convenient by eliminating interaction 
                    between the customer and salespeople. Users can view which items are in stock,
                    choose from multiple payment options, input the code of the desired item, and collect it from the slot it
                    falls into.

                <h4>User Observation</h4>

                <p>
                    I observed several users of an on campus vending machine, during the day and later at night, to find general patterns of behaviour,
                    outliers, and pain points. I made the following <span style="color:rebeccapurple; font-weight: 550; color:rebeccapurple">key observations</span>:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>All users used the card reader for payment (credit/debit cards or student ID cards).</li>
                    <li>All users swiped their card through the card reader multiple times, either flipping the card around or 
                        changing the direction in which they swiped.</li>
                    <li>Most users looked at the screen after swiping their cards.</li>
                    <li>More users approached the vending machine at night than in the day.</li>
                    <li>Most users purchased one item. One user purchased multiple items, repeating the swipe-select-collect process multiple 
                        times - they apologized repeatedly to the person next to them for the time it took.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>User Interviews</h4>

                <p>I conducted three interviews with students who had used campus vending machines previously. My main <span style="color:rebeccapurple; font-weight: 550; color:rebeccapurple">questions</span> were:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>What motivates you to use a campus vending machine?</li>
                    <li>Is there a typical pattern to the times that you use vending machines?</li>
                    <li>Which method of payment do you like best?</li>
                    <li>Have you experienced any challenges in the process of using campus vending machines?</li>
                    <li>What would be your ideal way of conducting a full transaction at a vending machine?</li>
                </ol>

                <p>Through these interviews, I was able to gain deeper insight into their user experience and their pain points. Important <span style="color:rebeccapurple; font-weight: 550; color:rebeccapurple">findings</span> include:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>There are distinct motivations to use campus vending machines: first, to stock up when the user has a lot
                        of points to spend on their student card; second, as a last resort when no other store is accessible.</li>        
                    <li>Users tend to use vending machines more often at night, during weekdays, and during colder months
                        of the year.</li>
                    <li>Users prefer card payments (debit, credit, or student card) since they do not typically carry cash or coins; however, 
                        it is unclear which way to swipe the card and whether it's worked.</li>
                    <li>Other challenges: using a credit card loads a default $4 into the
                        machine even if a user only wants one item; there's no indication of how much time a user has to make
                        selections before the machine shuts down the transaction; and it is annoying that the collection door is so low down.</li>
                    <li>Some users would like to swipe a card at the machine and have it just take the 
                        cost of the desired item, so there is no waste of money; some would like to enter a total amount of money, add 
                        items until meeting that total, and be able to buy them all at once instead of one by one, saving
                        time.</li>
                </ol>
