            <h2>Background</h2>
            <div>
                After observing users and conducting interviews, I created user personas for a public on-campus vending 
                machine; I also created a storyboard for one user. The process taught me a lot - not only how to pick out 
                general patterns of user behaviour and segment users, but, surprisingly, that there are good and bad ways to
                ask questions in an interview.

                    Vending machines provide quick and easy access to a variety of snacks and drinks; a vending machine 
                    interface makes the process of buying a snack quicker and more convenient by offering variable payment 
                    options and eliminating interaction between the customer and salespeople.

                <h3>Key Components</h3>

            <h2>Process</h2>

            <div>
    
                <div>
                    I observed several users of an on campus vending machine, once in the day and once later at night (around 11 PM).
                </div>
    
                <div>
                    <h3>Key Observations</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>All users used the card reader for payment (credit/debit cards or student ID cards). </li>
                        <li>
                            All users swiped their card through the card reader multiple times, either flipping the card around or 
                            changing the direction in which they swiped.
                        </li>
                        <li>All users checked the screen after swiping their cards to see if it had worked.</li>
                        <li>
                            Most users looked back and forth between the display window and keypad multiple times before inputting 
                            their selection.
                        </li>
                        <li>Most users inputted their selections slowly and carefully.</li>
                        <li>
                            More users approached the vending machine at night than in the day. A few swiped once, didn't make 
                            a selection, and went away.
                        </li>
                        <li>Most users purchased one item.</li>
                        <li>
                            One user purchased multiple items (during the day), repeating the swipe-select-collect process multiple 
                            times - this user apologized repeatedly to the person next to them for the time it took.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
    
                <div>
                    I also interviewed three users for deeper insights.
                </div>
    
                <div>
                    <h3>Interview Summary</h3>
        
                    <h4>Questions</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>What motivates you to use a campus vending machine?</li>
                        <li>Is there a typical pattern to the times that you use vending machines?</li>
                        <li>Which method of payment do you like best?</li>
                        <li>Have you experienced any challenges in the process of using campus vending machines?</li>
                        <li>What would be your ideal way of conducting a full transaction at a vending machine?</li>
                    </ol>
        
                    <h4>Answers</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            There were two major motivations: first, to stock up on stacks after running out, and if the user has a lot
                            of points to spend on their student card; second, as a last resort when a user needs
                            a hit of sugar and nothing else is open or nearby.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Users tend to use vending machines more often at night, during weekdays, and during colder months
                            of the year.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Users prefer card payments since they do not typically carry cash or coins - either the student card if 
                            they have points on it, or credit/debit cards.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            It's difficult to tell which way to swipe your card and whether it has worked; you cannot buy lots of 
                            things with one swipe and must do multiple transactions; using a credit card loads a default $4 into the
                            machine even if you only want one item; there's no indication of how much time you have to make your
                            selections before the machine shuts down your transaction; and the collection door is low and annoying
                            to use.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Two distinct ideas were brought up: first, to swipe a card at the machine and have it just take the 
                            cost of the desired item, so there is no waste of money; second, to enter a total amount of money, add 
                            items until meeting that total, and be able to buy them all at once instead of one at a time, saving
                            time.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </div>
